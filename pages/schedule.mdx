# Workshops

If you don't have much background knowledge in computer science, or you're coming to EcoHacks hoping to learn something, well have something for you! Workshops are designed to teach you the knowledge and backgorund information you need to make your projects. They also might include special software license giveaways as well as special swag.

**We'll be posting a more detailed schedule in a bit!**
