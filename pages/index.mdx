## Help the Earth 🌎

There are so many companies working to change the world, but there aren't nearly enough dedicated to helping the environment. It's not profitable enough, or there are not enough people interested in working in that field. We hope to encourage YOU to make a dent in the world, create something, anything, to encourage even a single person to do more for the environment. After all, it's the little things that count!

## FAQ

<FAQ>

- **How much does it cost? 💸**
  Nothing! Registration and attendance are 100% free, with meals, drinks, swag, & workshops included. We'll even have prizes for the top scoring teams/individuals! We just want you there!

- **Who can participate? 🔭**
  Any current student grades 8–12. Anyone not in those grades could be accepted on a case by case basis. If you’re under/over that age, [email us](mailto:team@ecohacks.io) & we’ll see what we can do. If you're interested in mentoring or helping out, hit us up too!

- **Hacking? Is that safe? 👨🏿‍💻**
  No, we’re not “hacking” servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding—apps, games, websites. It’s safe, supervised, and entirely educational.

- **What can I make? 🤖**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, utility, and, last but not least, impact on the community.

- **What if I’m new to coding? 👾**
  At EcoHacks, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! We will have everything you need from mentors to workshops to learn on the spot!

- **Do I need a team? 👨‍👧‍👧**
  Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4—find some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.

- **What should I bring? 🧳**
  Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, anything for your hack (e.g. hardware), and enthusiasm! We'll provide snacks and meals, so you don't have to worry about that!

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised? 👨‍🏫**
  We’re independently-organized by high schoolers, from around the counry, sponsored via a nonprofit called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). It’s fully supervised with adult mentors & chaperones.
