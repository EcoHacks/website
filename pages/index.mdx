## FAQ

<Callout sx={{ mx: [null, null, -3, -4] }}>
<FAQ>

- **How much does it cost? 💸**
  Nothing! Registration and attendance are 100% free, with meals, drinks, swag, & workshops included. We'll even have prizes for the top scoring teams/individuals! We just want you there!

- **Who can participate? 🔭**
  Any current student grades 6–12. If you’re under/over that age, [email us](mailto:hello@angelhacks.org) & we’ll see what we can do. And if you're interested in mentoring or helping out, hit us up too!

- **Hacking? Is that safe? 👨🏿‍💻**
  No, we’re not “hacking” servers. The word is being constructively redefined for coding—apps, games, websites. It’s safe, supervised, and entirely educational.

- **What can I make? 🤖**
  Anything! A website, app, game, hardware hack, you name it. Judges will rate projects on creativity, technical skill demonstrated, polish, utility, and, last but not least, impact on the community.

- **What if I’m new to coding? 👾**
  At EcoHacks, complete beginners are not only welcome, but expected! We will have everything you need from mentors to workshops to learn on the spot!

- **Do I need a team? 👨‍👧‍👧**
  Nope! You’ll have an opportunity to meet fellow hackers and make teams of up to 4—find some new friends, bring yours, or work alone.

- **What should I bring? 🧳**
  Plan to bring a student ID, computer (any kind), chargers, anything for your hack (e.g. hardware), and enthusiasm! We'll provide snacks and meals, so you don't have to worry about that!

- **Who runs this? Is it supervised? 👨‍🏫**
  We’re independently-organized by high schoolers, from around the counry, sponsored via a nonprofit called [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/). It’s fully supervised with adult mentors & chaperones.
